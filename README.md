# Project 1 - Google Sheets - Compensation Plan
- PROBLEM: JK Studios has 10 members, each contributing different amounts of work in different roles on over 100 projects. How do we pay everyone fairly according to their work, as well as pay a portion to members as an equal distribution simply for their founding contribution to the brand?
- SOLUTION:
  - Held a meeting to convince the other 9 members of my plan.
  - Collaborated to determine the worth of every role that might be done by a member, and create a template grid. 
  - Created a "Video Template" with a grid of predetermined points where contributors points are added by the project manager.
  - Created a "Payroll Template". Every Pay period, data for the income from each project is downloaded and portioned out according to the points distribution for that project. Use the "Payroll template" which contains the spreadsheet relationships we established, and enter copy the video income into it.
  - Entered the totals calculated for each individual into our payroll system and got everyone paid.
- DUE TO SENSITIVE INFORMATION: I cannot display the spreadsheet workbook publicly. Please contact me for a preview where real numbers have been changed. Thanks!
